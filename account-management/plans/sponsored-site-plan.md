The Sponsored site plan lets you access all of GitBook’s best docs site features at no cost while displaying a small, relevant ad in the corner of your documentation site. Each view generates revenue for you, turning your documentation into a source of income.

### Apply for the Sponsored site plan

The Sponsored site plan is designed specifically for sites. View the steps below to learn how to publish your first sponsored site.

### Create and publish a Sponsored site

Begin by creating a new site from the site wizard and setting up your site with content. When asked to choose a plan, head to the **For open source** section, and choose the Sponsored site plan.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Submit your site for ad review

Your site must be [published **publicly**](../../published-documentation/publish-a-docs-site/public-publishing.md) for **seven days** before you can submit it for review.

Head to your site’s settings, and scroll down to the **Ads and sponsorship** section. From here, review the ads checklist to make sure your site meets all the requirements before submitting.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Wait for review

After submitting your application, here’s what you can expect:

* **Review process:** Your site will be reviewed, and you can expect an estimated review time of **up to seven days**. Please note that this timeline may be different based on processing delays.
* **Final status update:** After the review, we’ll update your site’s status. Your site will either be marked as **approved** or **rejected**, depending on the review outcome. If approved, ads will be added to your site and you can start earning money!
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### How it works

Once your site is live, here’s how the Sponsored site plan operates:

* **Earning potential:** Every time someone views your documentation, a small, relevant ad will be displayed in the bottom corner of each page. You earn money from every view, which you can use to support ongoing development efforts.
* **Ethical advertising:** At GitBook, we prioritize ethical advertising. Ads displayed on your site will never track or retarget your users, ensuring a respectful experience for your audience.
* **Visibility of content:** Your content remains the focus. Only one small ad will appear on each page, ensuring that your documentation is always front and center.
