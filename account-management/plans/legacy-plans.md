# Legacy plans

### Legacy plans

If you're subscribed to one of our legacy (**Team** or **Business**) plans, you have two options. You can:

1. Remain subscribed to the legacy plan; or
2. Switch to one of our new and improved pricing plans. If you choose this option, it will _not_ be possible to revert back to a legacy pricing plan later.

You can find the [full feature comparison](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing) for the new plans on our site, but here is a convenient comparison between the legacy and the new plans:
