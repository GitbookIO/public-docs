# Community plan

We welcome applications for our community plan from organizations that meet certain criteria. Broadly, these fall into one of three categories:

1. Non-profit organizations
2. Open source organizations
3. Education-related groups

{% hint style="info" %}
If you won’t need to collaborate with others and/or can use [Git Sync](../../../getting-started/git-sync/) to collaborate via GitHub and GitLab then your needs should be covered by our Free plan!

If you want to publish a docs site for free too, you can choose from either a Basic site with limited features, or [a Sponsored site](sponsored-site-plan.md) which has more features and earns you funding through small, relevant ads. See [our open source page](https://www.gitbook.com/solutions/open-source) for more details on these plans.
{% endhint %}

If you will **need** to collaborate with others, then please continue reading.
