We welcome applications for our OSS plan from organizations that meet certain criteria. Broadly, these fall into one of three categories:

1. Non-profit organizations
2. Open source projects
3. Small education-related groups

{% hint style="info" %}
If you won't need to collaborate with others, then your needs should be covered by our free Personal plan!

It allows you to publish content to the world and even supports linking a [custom domain](../../publishing/custom-domain/) to each of your spaces.
{% endhint %}

If you will **need** to collaborate with others, then please continue reading.
