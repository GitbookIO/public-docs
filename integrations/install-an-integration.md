# Install and manage integrations

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6TA9Lftd6A" %}

You can install an integration in a single space, multiple spaces, or all the spaces across your organization.

If you install an integration in a single space, it will only work in that specific space. By installing an integration in multiple spaces, you’ll be able to perform actions across all those spaces.

### Install an integration in your organization

#### 1. Open the Integrations menu

Before enabling an integration into a space or site, you'll need to install it in your organization. Start by clicking **Integrations** in the sidebar on the left.

#### 2. Select the integration and install

Next, click on the integration you want to install on the space (e.g Plausible).

This will open up the integration’s installation screen. Click **Install** to connect it to your organization.

From here, the integration will be available to enable in any space or site in your organization.

#### 3. Enable and configure integration

The installed installed will now be available in your organization, but you need to enable it on a per-space basis, and you may also need to configure it, depending on the integration

Firstly, open the integration’s main screen by selecting it on the **Integrations** panel in the app and opening the **Spaces tab**. From here, you can choose which space(s) to enable the integration for.

Certain integrations may require extra configuration. If so, head to the **Organization settings** tab to complete your integration’s configuration.
