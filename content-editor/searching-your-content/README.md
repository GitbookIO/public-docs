# Searching content

Whether you’re working within the GitBook app or your visitors are reading your published content, GitBook’s search functions help to make it easy to find what you’re looking for.&#x20;

You can use quick find to look for specific words or phrases, or you can ask GitBook AI a question. It’ll scan through your docs and summarize an answer in seconds, with references to help you find out more.

**Permissions**\
For **published content**, anyone can use the built-in **Search** bar in the top-right of the screen to find the answers or pages they’re looking for.

For **internal content,** all member roles can use the **quick find** search bar in the top-left of the screen. However, members will only be able to search the internal content they have permission to access.‌
