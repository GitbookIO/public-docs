# Spaces

A space is a project that lets you work on a collection of related pages. Imagine it as a virtual book where you can start writing pages individually or collaborate asynchronously with your team members.

### Create a space

Click the **+** button next to the **Documentation** header in the sidebar and choose **New space** to create a new space. You can also create a new space from a [collection](what-is-a-collection.md).

You can move a space by opening the space’s **Action menu** <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="Three vertical dots" data-size="line"> in the sidebar, selecting **Move space to…** and choosing a destination. Alternatively, you can drag and drop spaces in the sidebar to move or reorder them.\

You can move spaces between collections or even organizations, as long as you have an [admin role](../../../account-management/member-management/roles.md) in both.

### Delete a space
