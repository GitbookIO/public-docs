# Drawings

You can create a drawing or sketch directly though GitBook using the integrated [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) editor, then add it right into your GitBook page.

To create a drawing, press `/` on an empty line to bring up the insert palette and choose **Drawing**. This will open a popover with Excalidraw tools — simply close the popover when you’re done and your diagram will appear on your GitBook page.

GitBook stores drawings as special SVG files in the space. Those files have an extension of `drawing.svg`.
