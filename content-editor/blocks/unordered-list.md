# Unordered lists

Unordered lists are great for making a series of points that do not necessarily need to be made in a particular order. They are effectively bullet point lists, with support for nesting as needed.

When typing a list in GitBook, you can exit the list and start a new empty block below by hitting  `Enter` twice.

### Example of unordered list

* Item
  * Nested item
    * Another nested item
  * Yet another nested item
* Another item
* Yet another item

{% hint style="info" %}
To create nested items, you can use **Tab** to indent and **⇧ + Tab** to outdent.
{% endhint %}

### Representation in Markdown

```markdown
- Item
   - Nested item
      - Another nested item
   - Yet another nested item
- Another item
- Yet another item
```
