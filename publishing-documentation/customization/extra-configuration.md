# Extra configuration

### Localize user interface

You can select from a list of languages to localize the user interface of your published content. This applies translations to the non-custom areas of the interface.

This setting will _not_ auto-translate your actual content, but it can help match the interface to the language you’re writing in.

Is there a language we don’t yet offer that you’d like to see included? [Let us know](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues), or [contribute your own translation](https://www.gitbook.com/solutions/open-source)!

### Edit on GitHub/GitLab

If your space is connected to a Git repository, you can optionally show a link for your users to contribute to your documentation from your linked repository.

### External Links

This setting controls the behaviour when your site users click an external link. By default, they will open in the same tab, but you can switch this to open in a new tab if that's your preference.

### Page actions

Page actions adds a page-level dropdown to every page of your docs, allowing users to perform quick actions on a page's content — ideal for using your docs content as context within an AI prompt.&#x20;

You can disable this option from the **Configure** tab if you do not wish to show page options in your published docs.

#### Open in AI providers

#### Copy/View as Markdown

### Privacy Policy
