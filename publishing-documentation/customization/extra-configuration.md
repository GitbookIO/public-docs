# Extra configuration

In the **Configuration** tab you can change other settings associated with your site. For example, you can set up interface localization, link behavior, and page actions that help your users add your content to AI tools like ChatGPT.

On this page you’ll learn what each of these options does and how to enable or disable them.

### Localize user interface

You can select from a list of languages to localize the user interface of your published content. This applies translations to the non-custom areas of the interface.

This setting will _not_ auto-translate your actual content, but it can help match the interface to the language you’re writing in. To learn more about translating your content, head to the [Translations](../../creating-content/translations.md) section.

Is there a language we don’t yet offer that you’d like to see included? [Let us know](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues), or [contribute your own translation](https://www.gitbook.com/solutions/open-source)!

### Primary link

In the **Primary link** section of the **Configure** tab, you can set a custom URL for the logo in the top-left corner of your docs site.

By default, clicking the logo or site title will lead users back to the first page of your docs site. You can set a custom URL outside your site — or a page, section or variant on your site — to be opened instead. If your docs are part of a larger website this can help visitors navigate back to your own landing page.

### External links

The **External links** section in the **Configure** tab controls the behavior when your site users click a link to an external URL. By default, these links will open in the same tab, but you can switch this to open in a new tab if that’s your preference.

### Page actions

Page actions adds a page-level dropdown to every page of your docs, allowing users to perform quick actions on a page's content — ideal for using your docs content as context within an AI prompt.&#x20;

You can disable this option from the **Configure** tab if you do not wish to show page options in your published docs.

#### Open in AI providers

Enable this option to display an action to open ChatGPT or Claude with the page content.

#### Copy/View as Markdown

Enable this option to display an action to copy or view the page as Markdown.

#### Edit on GitHub/GitLab

If your space is connected to a Git repository, you can enable this option in the **Configure** tab to show a link for your users to contribute to your documentation from your linked repository.

#### Export PDF

Enable this option to allow visitors to [export a PDF](../../collaboration/pdf-export.md) of your documentation.

### Privacy policy

In the **Privacy policy** section of the **Configure** tab, you can link to your own privacy policy to help visitors understand how your GitBook content uses cookies and how you protect their privacy. If you choose not to set one, your site will default to [GitBook’s privacy policy](https://gitbook.com/docs/policies/privacy-and-security/statement/cookies).
