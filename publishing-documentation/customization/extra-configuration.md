# Extra configuration

### Localize user interface

You can select from a list of languages to localize the user interface of your published content. This applies translations to the non-custom areas of the interface.

This setting will _not_ auto-translate your actual content, but it can help match the interface to the language you’re writing in.

Is there a language we don’t yet offer that you’d like to see included? [Let us know](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues), or [contribute your own translation](https://www.gitbook.com/solutions/open-source)!

### Edit on GitHub/GitLab

If your space is connected to a Git repository, you can optionally show a link for your users to contribute to your documentation from your linked repository.

### Privacy Policy

You can link to your own privacy policy to help visitors understand how your GitBook content uses cookies and how you protect their privacy. If you choose not to set one, your site will default to [GitBook’s privacy policy](https://policies.gitbook.com/privacy-and-security/statement/cookies).
