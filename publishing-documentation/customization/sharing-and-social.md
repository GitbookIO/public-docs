# Sharing and social

### Social accounts

You can add social accounts to your site’s metadata and footer from the **Sharing** tab in the customization menu.

Click **+ Add account** and choose an account type from the list of included options — such as X, GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord and Bluesky. Adding a social account in this menu also adds it to your site’s metadata.&#x20;

For each social account, you can toggle its visibility in your docs site’s footer on or off, without affecting the metadata.
