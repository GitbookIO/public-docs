# Sharing and social

### Social accounts

You can add social accounts to your site’s metadata and footer from the **Sharing** tab in the customization menu.

Click **+ Add account** and choose an account type from the list of included options — such as X, GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord and Bluesky. Adding a social account in this menu also adds it to your site’s metadata.&#x20;

For each social account, you can toggle its visibility in your docs site’s footer on or off, without affecting the metadata.

### Social preview

Here, you can upload a custom social preview image for your site. This will set the site’s `og:image` to your uploaded image, and it’ll show when the site’s link is shared to any platform or product that supports OpenGraph images, such as Slack or X.

If you don’t add a social preview, GitBook will automatically generate one using your theme color, page title and description.

If your site has multiple [site sections](../site-structure/site-sections.md), you can use the drop-down menu at the top of the Customization screen to switch between each section and add a custom social preview image for each one.
