# PDF export

### Allow readers to export a PDF version of your published content

{% include "../.gitbook/includes/premium-and-ultimate-hint.md" %}

To enable or disable PDF export for visitors to your [published docs site](broken-reference/), open the docs site’s dashboard, open the **Customization** tab, and navigate to **Configure → Page actions**. From there, you can toggle **Export as PDF** on or off.

This setting determines whether or not **readers of your published content can download it in PDF format**. This feature is only available for **Premium and Ultimate sites**.

### Export your own internal content as PDF

However you decide to configure your published docs sites, all logged-in members of an organization on a Pro or Enterprise can export a page — or an entire space — from your internal knowledge base as a PDF file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that links across spaces are not currently supported when exporting internal content to PDF.
{% endhint %}
