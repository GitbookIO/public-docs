# Private publishing with share links

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, [visit our pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

You can share you content privately with customers or partners without needing to invite them to your organization by using secret links.

### Publish with share links

To publish your docs privately, head to the [docs site’s ](../site-settings.md)settings, click **Audience settings** button, and choose the **Share links** option.

Next, click on **Create link** to create a share link. You can review and name your share links, customize your domain and copy the link.

Once the link is active, a private token is generated within your URL, which is unique to your space. Sharing this link will give non-GitBook users access to your content in read mode only, with an interface that looks like any other published content.

You can generate as many links as you need from **Audience settings**.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can [revoked](share-links.md#revoke-a-link) and regenerate share links at any time.
{% endhint %}

### Access and permissions

The content will be accessible to **anyone following the link**. Your team members can access your content from the **Docs sites** section of the sidebar, or by navigating to the space directly.

### Revoke a link

You can disable or regenerate your shareable by revoking it. You can see and revoke any previously generated link by opening the visibility menu and clicking through to link and domain settings.&#x20;

Once you revoke a link, anyone with that outdated link to your content will no longer have access.
