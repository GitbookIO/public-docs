# 4. Finalize the custom domain setup

Once your CNAME record is successfully added within your DNS settings through your DNS provider, you can continue the domain connection process in GitBook.&#x20;

### Finalize the domain setup

After completing the second and third steps, the **Configure your DNS** screen should let you advance by clicking **Ready: Go Live.** This starts GitBook’s validation process.&#x20;

During this phase, GitBook verifies your CNAME record and configures the SSL certificate for your domain, ensuring a secure connection.&#x20;

When this process is finished, a success notification confirms that your site is live. Although this process generally proceeds without issues, occasional errors can occur.&#x20;
