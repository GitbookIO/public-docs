# Task lists

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes that you can check or uncheck.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Readers of your published space will not be able to check or uncheck these boxes. You can decide which boxes are checked and unchecked when you create the content.
{% endhint %}

### Example of a task list

* [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
  * [x] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `Tab`.
  * [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
* [ ] Finally, an item, unindented using `shift` + `tab`.

### Representation in markdown

```markdown
- [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done
  - [x] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `tab`
  - [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done.
