# Search & Quick find

GitBook’s **Quick find** palette lets you search for content in your current organization, and jump to pages fast.

### Use Quick find

**​**You can open the **Quick find** palette by hitting the **Quick find** <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/25_07_16_quick_find_1.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/25_07_16_quick_find.svg" alt=""></picture> button at the top of the sidebar or by pressing **⌘ + K** on Mac or **Ctrl + K** on PC.

### Search results <a href="#display-of-results" id="display-of-results"></a>

Results from the space you’re currently in appear at the top, followed by results from other spaces in the organization you’re currently working in.

To search another organization, switch organizations first using [the organization switcher](../../resources/gitbook-ui/#the-sidebar).

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not currently support the ability to prioritize certain content in Quick find results.
{% endhint %}

### Permissions <a href="#team-permissions" id="team-permissions"></a>

**Quick find** is compliant with your team’s permission settings, meaning that users will only be able to search the content they have permission to access.‌

### Content indexing <a href="#indexation" id="indexation"></a>

We index your content by grouping it into sections. Sections are denoted using [H1, H2 or H3 Headings](../blocks/heading.md), with the content that follows them forming part of a section.

Each result shows the first three lines of information below the section header. If your section is too big, your keyword match may not appear in the preview — but don’t worry, quick find still found a match!
