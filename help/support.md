# How do I contact support?

There are two ways to get in touch with us:

- You can submit a support request via the GitBook app. When you’re logged in, click on the **cog** :gear: **icon** in the [sidebar](https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started/overview#sidebar). Click **Help & Feedback** and then click **Contact Support**.
- You can email [support@gitbook.com](mailto:support@gitbook.com) directly.

## What information should I share?

To help _us_ help _you_ as efficiently as possible, please be sure to send us all relevant details:

- If your support request relates to a specific space, please make sure to include a link to it.
- Please describe the steps that you are taking, what happens when you take those steps, and what you expect to happen instead.
- If you are running into an error message, please pass along the error message in full.
- Can you send us a screenshot to show us what you’re seeing? Or, can you send us a short video to show us the steps that you are taking? These are extremely helpful.

## When will I get a response?

We aim to respond to every message within 1 business day. At busy times this might not be possible, but we’ll always get back to you as soon as we are able.&#x20;

Please note our support team works Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm GMT (+/- 3 hours).&#x20;

## Why has the support widget changed?

We’ve made some internal changes to help us improve the support that we offer. As part of these changes, we have moved to a new help desk system. The main differences you’ll notice are:

- We have a new workflow in the GitBook app to use when sending us a support request.
- Our workflow will gather the key information we need to help us assist you faster.&#x20;

Please note that **we do not offer real-time support** via this widget, this isn’t something that we can currently provide. We aim to respond as soon as possible and when we do, your inbox will notify you!
